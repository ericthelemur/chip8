# CHIP-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 emulator built as a full example for Warwick Computing Society's Rust Course [RS118](https://rs118.uwcs.co.uk/chip8.html).

Development following the tutorial can be found at [ericthelemur/chip9(]https://github.com/ericthelemur/chip9), but this uses the version of `chip8-base`. This repo follows on adding the extra functionality to make it a fully functional CHIP-8 interpreter.
